# üöÄ Detailed Setup Instructions

### 1. Make Your Own Copy

- Click **Create repository**.

---

### 2. Customize Your News Sources

- Before you first publish, you can use this [feeds.json config tool](https://technoid99.github.io/my_news_feed/config.html) to build your ```feeds.json``` file content. After you publish use your own config tool (```https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/config.html```) as it'll pull in your existing feeds.json file so you can better edit it.
- Use the simple web form to edit, add, or remove RSS feeds.
- After making changes, **copy** the updated JSON text.
- Then:
  - Click `feeds.json` in your repository file listing
  - Click the ‚úèÔ∏è **edit button**.
  - Paste your updated feeds.json.
  - Save the changes.

‚úÖ Now you control exactly what news you see!

---

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages / Publish!

- In your new repository, go to **Settings**.
- Scroll down to **Pages**.
- Under **"Source"**, select:
  - **Branch:** `main`
  - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
- Click **Save**.

‚úÖ After a few seconds, GitHub will give you a live web link to your personal news feed!

---

### 4. How Updates Work

- Every morning at **6AM AEST (Australia Eastern Standard Time)**,
  GitHub Actions will automatically update your news feed.
- You don't need to do anything ‚Äî it refreshes itself!
- Note: if you wish to update outside of this schedule got to Actions (top menu) > "Update News Feed Daily" (left menu) > Run workflow dropdown (right side) > Run workflow.

---

### 5. View Your Personal News Feed

- Visit your GitHub Pages link (found in **Settings ‚Üí Pages**).
- Use the source filter, time filter and keyword filter to your liking.
- Bookmark it for quick access! (yes, even with the filters!)

‚úÖ You can filter articles by:
- Source
- Time range (24h, 48h, 7d, or all time)
- Keyword search (supports **AND**, **OR**, and **"quoted phrases"**) eg. (grapes OR berries) AND apples -bananas

## üõ† Requirements

- A GitHub account.

No servers.  
No coding beyond basic file editing.  
No installations.  
Just GitHub + RSS!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Under the Hood)

- `main.py` pulls articles from your selected RSS feeds using Python and `feedparser`.
- It generates an `index.html` page listing all articles.
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`update_feed.yml`) runs `main.py` automatically every day.
- Changes are committed back to your repository if anything new appears.
- GitHub Pages serves your latest news to the world.

## üí° Tips

- Bookmark your feed with customised filters (source selection, keywords, time range) ‚Äî they are saved in the URL!
- Add niche topics (e.g., science, regional news, personal interests).
- Remove or add feeds anytime by editing `feeds.json`.

## üí° Advanced Tips

### Add a Google News search as an RSS feed

1. Create a bookmarklet
a. Copy this javascript code that obtains the exact search query and makes it an RSS feed ```javascript:(function(){let url=window.location.href;if(url.includes('news.google.com/')){url=url.replace('news.google.com/','news.google.com/rss/');navigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(()=>alert('RSS URL copied to clipboard!')).catch(err=>console.error('Copy failed',err));}else{alert('Not a Google News page.');}})();```
b. Create a new bookmark in your browser. (I like to save it to Bookmarks bar for easy access)
c. Paste it into the URL field of the bookmark.
d. Name it something like "Get Google News RSS".

2. Manually search using Google News
a. Go to [https://news.google.com/](https://news.google.com/)
b. Run your news search query or click on a Topic heading.
c. While on your resulting Google News search page, click the bookmarklet. It will copy the RSS feed URL to your clipboard.

3. Go to your my_news_feed Config file or use [this one](https://technoid99.github.io/my_news_feed/config.html) from the template and use the copied URL as your RSS URL.
